# Basic Pointer in C++
## Aim
We learn about declaring, initializing and basic features of pointers in C++.
## Theory
In C++, pointers are variables that store memory addresses, typically the location of another variable. They are declared using the asterisk (* ) symbol. For example, int* ptr declares a pointer ptr to an integer. The address-of operator & is used to obtain the address of a variable, while the dereference operator * is used to access the value at the memory address pointed to by the pointer.

Pointers are powerful because they enable direct memory manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and efficient array and structure handling. They are essential in scenarios like passing large structures to functions by reference, which avoids copying the entire structure. Pointers can also be used to navigate through arrays, as an array name acts as a pointer to its first element.

Dynamic memory allocation, handled through pointers, is achieved using the new and delete operators, allowing for the creation and destruction of variables at runtime. Understanding pointers is fundamental for efficient memory management and advanced programming techniques in C++.
