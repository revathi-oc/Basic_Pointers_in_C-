# Pointer Basic in C++
## Aim
We learn about declaring, initializing and basic features of pointers in C++.
## Theory
In C++, pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are a powerful feature that allows direct manipulation of memory, providing greater control and efficiency in programming. A pointer is declared using the asterisk (*) symbol, for example, int *ptr; creates a pointer to an integer. The address-of operator (&) is used to get the memory address of a variable, while the dereference operator (*) is used to access the value stored at the address a pointer holds.

Pointers support arithmetic operations like incrementing (ptr++), which moves the pointer to the next memory location based on the data type size. Pointers are crucial for dynamic memory allocation using new and delete, enabling the creation of dynamic arrays and linked data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.

Function pointers allow functions to be passed as arguments or returned from other functions, enhancing flexibility in program design. Understanding pointers is fundamental to mastering C++ as they provide the means for low-level memory manipulation, efficient array handling, and dynamic data structures. However, improper use of pointers can lead to errors like memory leaks or segmentation faults, so careful management is essential.
